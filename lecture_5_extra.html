                In this extra part of the lecture, we are going to look on how you can pilot an X3 drone inside of Gazebo.<br>
                By the end of this part, your Patrolling Turtle code from exercise 5 should be working also on a flying drone.

                Moving objects in a 3D space can be really hard with no prior-knowledge.
                With the addition of a third dimension, rotations have now three possible axis, instead of simply one.<br>
                Let's take a look at the drone in figure:
