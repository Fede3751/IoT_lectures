            <p class="section">Exercise 8d - Moving towards a point</p>

            <p>

                Now that the drone is facing the point, it should move towards it.<br><br>

                Moving in a 3D space can get quite confusing when working in 3D spaces.<br>
                Theoretically, in order to find the movement vector, you would have to calculate
                the vector between the two points in space and then rotate it using the drone as
                a frame of reference.<br><br>

                In practice, we won't need to do that: if you did the previous step, it means that the 
                drone is already facing the target, so it only has to move in two directions to reach it:
                forward and up/down.<br><br>

                If you manage to find the 2D vector in this plane, your drone will move correctly. Give it a try!<br><br>

                Assuming that the movement is described by a vector (x,y,z), we are interested in a single forward component
                created by the vectors x and y (as we want to move the drone always forward), and the value of z
                (not absolute, we want negatives values here, as the drone may need to fly to a lower point to reach its target).<br><br>

            <p class="section">Exercise 8e - Patrolling</p>
            
            <p>

                These exercise are left for you to do it on your own, as they were not discussed in class.<br>
                Solution for them will be published next week when we will officialy present the IoT Project and challenge!<br><br>

                We have everything ready to move the drone from point A to point B.<br><br>

                Can we generalize that approach to a set of points? And move from one point to another in a given order?<br>
                You should just iterate what we have built so far over a set of points. Give it a try!

            <p class="section">Exercise 8f - Swarming</p>
            
            <p>
                Everything is ready.<br><br>

                What you are requested here, is to edit your world sdf file to spawn two additional drones.<br><br>

                By working with remappings and/or namespaces in your launch file, your code should control the three drones to perform the patrolling
                task for each of them.<br><br>

            <p class="section">Conclusions</p>

            <p>
                We are done.<br>
                The code written in this lecture will be the starting point of your project.<br><br>

                The complete solution to all the exercises proposed will be available here next week, when we will present you the IoT Project.<br>
                Note that the solution to these exercises which will be provided will have a considerable amount of room for improvement, so your solution for this exercises may actually be
                better than the code we will provide.<br><br>
                
                If you want to test your solution before the official presentation of the project, a first version of the project simulation is now available here:
                <br><a href="https://github.com/Fede3751/IoT-Project">IoT-Project</a><br><br>

                Note that the way the scoring is currently calculated is subject to change and will get updated once we officially present the project.<br>
                Feel free to use the current version to get used to the workspace and the topics that the project uses, those will be more or less the same.<br>
                Additionally, a good solution for this patrolling problem may still get a good score even with a more complex grader.<br><br>

                In the next lecture we will officially present the IoT Project and Challenge!
                If you are able to complete the rest of the exercises and link them with the project simulaton on your own, you have one week of head start!<br><br>
                
                Have fun and good luck!

            <p>
                Moving objects in a 3D space can be really hard with no prior-knowledge.
                With the addition of a third dimension, rotations have now three possible axis, instead of simply one.<br>
