            <p class="section">Exercise 8d - Moving towards a point</p>

            <p>

                Now that the drone is facing the point, it should move towards it.<br><br>

                Moving in a 3D space can get quite confusing when working in 3D spaces.<br>
                Theoretically, in order to find the movement vector, you would have to calculate
                the vector between the two points in space and then rotate it using the drone as
                a frame of reference.<br><br>

                In practice, we won't need to do that: if you did the previous step, it means that the 
                drone is already facing the target, so it only has to move in two directions to reach it:
                forward and up/down.<br><br>

                If you manage to find the 2D vector in this plane, your drone will move correctly. Give it a try!<br><br>

                Assuming that the movement is described by a vector (x,z), we are interested in the absolute value of x
                (as we want to move the drone always forward), and the value of z (not absolute, we want negatives values here,
                as the drone may need to fly to a lower point to reach its target).<br><br>

            <p class="section">Exercise 8e - Patrolling</p>
            
            <p>

                We have everything ready to move the drone from point A to point B.<br><br>

                Can we generalize that approach to a set of points? And move from one point to another in a given order?<br>
                You should just iterate what we have built so far over a set of points. Give it a try!

            <p class="section">Exercise 8f - Swarming</p>
            
            <p>
                Everything is ready.<br><br>

                What you are requested here, is to edit your world sdf file to spawn two additional drones.<br><br>

                By working with remappings and/or namespaces in your launch file, your code should control the three drones to perform the patrolling
                task for each of them.<br><br>

            <p class="section">Conclusions</p>

            <p>
                We are done.<br>
                The code written in this lecture will be the starting point of your project.<br><br>

                The complete solution to all the exercises proposed will be available here the end of this week.<br>
                Note that the solution which will be provided will have a considerable amount of room for improvemnt, so your solutions for the exercise may actually be
                better than the code we will proivde.<br><br>
                The code to use for you to test your solution will be available here after the lecture, and will include a new launch file which will automatically
                start all the testing environment for you.<br><br>

                

                Have fun!

            <p>
                Moving objects in a 3D space can be really hard with no prior-knowledge.
                With the addition of a third dimension, rotations have now three possible axis, instead of simply one.<br>
